Certainly! Here's the revised text for inclusion in your GitHub README:

## Project Overview

This project focuses on curating a comprehensive database of information sourced from recent literature on OTAs. The primary objective is to maintain a synoptic overview of the current state of the art by contextualizing the innovations introduced in various scientific contributions.

### Features:

- **Data-driven Insights:** The database is implemented using an Excel spreadsheet and supported by simple scripts within a web-based interactive notebook. This setup allows for easy updating, expansion, and modification of the database to display data according to different criteria.

- **Flexibility and Customization:** Users can seamlessly update and modify the database to accommodate new research findings, emerging trends, and evolving criteria for analysis.

- **Contextualization of Innovations:** By organizing and contextualizing the information from literature, the database facilitates a deeper understanding of the innovations and advancements within the OTA landscape.

### How to Contribute:

Contributions to the database are welcome and encouraged! Whether it's adding new data, refining existing entries, or suggesting improvements to the analysis process, your input helps enrich the collective knowledge base.
